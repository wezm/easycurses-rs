//! This is a crate that allows one to easily use a basic form of curses. It is
//! based upon [pancurses](https://docs.rs/crate/pancurses) and so it's cross
//! platform between windows and unix. It exposes a simplified view of curses
//! functionality where there's just one Window and all of your actions are
//! called upon a single struct type, `EasyCurses`. This ensures that curses
//! functions are only called while curses is initialized, and also that curses
//! is always cleaned up at the end (via `Drop`).
//!
//! The library can only perform proper automatic cleanup if Rust is allowed to
//! run the `Drop` implementation. This happens during normal usage, and during
//! an unwinding panic, but if you ever abort the program (either because you
//! compiled with `panic=abort` or because you panic during an unwind) you lose
//! the cleanup safety. That is why this library specifies `panic="unwind"` for
//! all build modes, and you should too.
